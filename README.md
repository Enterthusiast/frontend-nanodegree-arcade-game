Game Manual
===========

How to play ?
- Open the gh-page URL of the github project. Mine is https://enterthusiast.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/
- Wait for the game to load, as soon as you see the ladybugs moving on screen, you're good to go!
- As a player you are controlling the little boy at the bottom center of the grass.
- To move the boy around use the arrow keys, the boy will follow your lead: up arrow, the boy goes up one tile; right arrow, the boy go right one tile; etc.

Goal
- Cross the paved lanes to reach the water, then make as many points as you can.
- You make one point each time you move from paved lanes to other paved lanes, or to the water tiles.
- Try to beat your own high score; mine is 41, I'm sure you can do better.

Game Over & Respawn
- When the boy is hit by a ladybug, you loose. The game reset, your score is lost and you must restart your progress.
- However when the boy reach the water it's a small succes. The game move the boy back to the bottom center of the grass, you keep your points and can continue to score!

Protip
- You can move back and forth between the paved lanes to get more point quicker; don't be greedy though.
- Try playing on the right of the screen, it should help you anticipate.
- Moving right or left on the paved lanes does not afford any point.

Enjoy!
